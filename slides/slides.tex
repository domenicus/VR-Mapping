\begin{frame}{Software toolchain}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We deliver all content through the browser. All of our code is
			JavaScript and HTML. 
		\item We do not have a serverside component; any HTTP
			server will do (e.g. Apache, Nginx).\\
		\item To access VR we depend on the WebVR browser API, the
			Gamepad API, and the A-Frame JavaScript library.
		\item Firefox controls the headset on our behalf through SteamVR.
	\end{enumerate}

	When we set out, we wanted to ensure we weren't tied to a single headset
	or a single computer. The easiest way to achieve this is to use a
	headset-agnostic, OS-agnostic framework like A-Frame.\\
	A-Frame is completely open source, meaning that we can make our own
	modified copies and keep and distribute them without issue. This avoids
	relying on a commercial software licencing agreement for future availability.

\begin{frame}{How to make reality convincing}
	We started with very basic environments, like rooms with flat maps on
	the wall. We learned a variety of important lessons:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Sharp transitions are scary, slow transitions are
			nauseating.
		\item Turning around is annoying.
		\item Boring space is bad space.
	\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Compass}
	\begin{columns}[t]
		\begin{column}{.3\textwidth}
			\adjincludegraphics[width=.8\linewidth,valign=t]{portal}
			\adjincludegraphics[width=.8\linewidth,valign=t]{portal2}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{.7\textwidth}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item At first, we just started people in front of a map.
			This was not exciting.
		\item So, we added an introductory space, with a 'portal' to get in.
			We made our 'portal' by putting an image on the 'inside' of a globe,
			and making the walls transparent from the outside.
		\item We ultimately transformed the introductory space to the literal vision
			of space we now have, but the portal had captured out attention as
			the 'Aleph' from Borges.
		\item We kept the portal, since it was a good (and philosophically satisfying)
			transition.
	\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Compass}
	\begin{columns}[t]
		\begin{column}{.3\textwidth}
			\adjincludegraphics[width=.8\linewidth,valign=t]{compass}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{.7\textwidth}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To really have an Aleph, we needed to be able to access
			\textbf{all} the maps, not just one.
		\item We put all the maps in one little portal, and let the user select which
			one they want. This was also very convenient!
		\item We decided to use a motif from one of the maps we studied, a compass.
		\item We made a 3D model and attached it to the portal, making it feel more physical.
	\end{enumerate}
		\end{column}
	\end{columns}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Voices}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We first experimented with having a box of information on one side of the screen.
		\item Reading text in VR is both boring and occasionally difficult.
		\item So, we decided to have voice annotations. 
		\item We created a flat, non-VR tool to
			graphically map audio files onto the map.
		\item We used to play audio whenever the user looked at the right area, but it was
			annoying.
		\item We play the audio back when the user zooms in -- giving them context only
			when they ask for it.
